## I. Introduction
Naver Map is a widely used mapping application in South Korea, offering users a range of location-based services, including navigation, local business information, and real-time traffic updates. The app aims to provide users with an intuitive and efficient platform for accessing accurate and reliable mapping data.
## II. Issues and Challenges
- The recommendation system in Naver Map fails to fully meet user expectations, particularly in the context of restaurant recommendations. While the filtering feature accurately displays all currently open restaurants, the system does not account for users' immediate needs. For instance, it lacks the capability to identify restaurants that are about to close soon. This limitation significantly impacts user experience, as individuals may face difficulties finding suitable dining options, especially when they have limited time and need to locate restaurants that can accommodate them before closing hours.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- To address this issue, the Naver Map application can implement a feature that identifies restaurants that are close to their closing time, providing users with an additional filtering option to view establishments that will remain open for a specified duration, such as the next 30 minutes. This enhancement will significantly enhance the user experience, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about their dining choices based on real-time information and ensuring that they can find suitable dining options that align with their immediate requirements. By integrating this solution, Naver Map can effectively improve its recommendation system, further enhancing user satisfaction and engagement with the application.
