## I. Introduction
EBS Bandi is a digital platform that provides users with access to a diverse range of Internet radio channels, EBS's AOD (Audio On Demand) contents, and podcast materials. The service aims to offer a comprehensive and engaging audio content experience to its users. 
## II. Issues and Challenges
- The EBS Bandi application suffers from poor usability, primarily stemming from the way it handles recently listened content. Users often encounter inconvenience when attempting to resume listening after a break, as the application prominently displays previously listened-to content. This design flaw hinders users from easily accessing new content and requires them to navigate back to a previously played item to find the subsequent content, disrupting the seamless listening experience.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- To address this issue, EBS Bandi can revamp the user interface by prioritizing the display of upcoming or recommended content on the home screen. By prominently featuring the next suggested content, the application can facilitate seamless continuation of listening sessions for users. Additionally, the implementation of a "Resume Listening" feature that automatically plays the next available content in the queue can further enhance the user experience, allowing users to effortlessly continue their listening journey without the need for manual navigation.
