## I. Introduction
Unified Reservation Service (URS) is the designated online platform that facilitates the reservation of common spaces within the KAIST campus. The primary objective of this service is to simplify the reservation process for students, faculty, and staff members. Through the URS, users can efficiently book a variety of spaces, including study rooms, conference halls, and other shared facilities, promoting effective utilization of campus resources. 
## II. Issues and Challenges
- **Challenges of intuitive categorization:** The user experience with the service directory in the Unified Reservation Service (URS) is hindered by a lack of intuitive category options. Upon selecting the service directory, users are prompted to choose between categorizing their search 'by usage' or 'by building.' However, both these options present difficulties in user comprehension. In the case of 'by usage,' the distinctions between 'conference,' 'seminar,' and 'event' are not clearly defined, leading to potential confusion for the user. Similarly, the 'by building' option displays lists of building numbers that lack clear contextual information, requiring users to double-check and cross-reference to ensure they select the specific building they intend to use. As a result, this ambiguity and lack of intuitive categorization contribute to a suboptimal user experience, potentially leading to frustration and inefficiencies in the reservation process.
- **Challenges of Inadequate Room Descriptions:** Another significant challenge arises from the insufficient descriptions of the purpose and usage of various rooms. This limitation complicates the user experience, particularly for those who have no prior familiarity with the rooms available. As a result, users may face difficulties in selecting a room that precisely aligns with their intended purposes, leading to potential confusion and inefficiencies in the reservation process.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- Provide clearer and more descriptive labels for the 'by usage' options, ensuring that the distinctions between 'conference', 'seminar' and 'event' are well-defined and easily understandable for users. 
- Append specific descriptions next to the building numbers, especially for buildings with specific functions like the library. For instatnce, instead of displaying 'E9', present it as 'E9 (Library)' to privide users with immediate context and clarity regarding the building's purpose. 
- Update the system to include comprehensive and informative descriptions for each available room, outlining the specific purposes and features of the rooms in a clear and concise manner.
