## I. Introduction
YouTube is a widely used online video-sharing platform that offers a diverse range of user-generated and professional content, including videos, tutorials, vlogs, and entertainment clips. The platform aims to provide users with a comprehensive and engaging video content experience.
## II. Issues and Challenges
- Lack of History Retrieval: On mobile and tablet devices, the absence of a reliable history retrieval system makes it impossible for users to revisit their previously curated combinations of content after accidental page refreshes. 
- Inefficient Visual Search Functionality: There is a serious issue with the search system. Users typically comprehend content visually, making them more likely to identify texts or images located in thumbnail images rather than the title below. However, the current search system appears to be only related to the textual title, as nothing comes up when I type the text in the thumbnail images.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- Implement a robust history retrieval feature on mobile and tablet devices that enables users to easily revisit their previously curated combinations of content, even after accidental page refreshes.
- Enhance the visual search functionality by integrating a comprehensive search system that indexes and recognizes visual elements within video thumbnails or cards, allowing users to find specific videos based on their visual content.
