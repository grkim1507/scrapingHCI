## I. Introduction
English clinic reservation is a service that offers undergraduates and graduates in KAIST to use a 25 minute face-to-face or online consultation for english speaking and writing for free. Student can prepare for interviews, feedback on emails, essays, presentations, test preparation or general conversation.
## II. Issues and Challenges
- The primary issue with the English Clinic Reservation lies in the user interface of the web page. While students can make reservations on a weekly basis, they encounter significant inconvenience as they can only determine the availability of appointments by manually clicking through each category individually. This cumbersome process results in a time-consuming and inefficient user experience, as students are unable to swiftly identify available time slots without navigating through the various categories one by one.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- Introduce an interactive calendar interface that enables students to view and select available time slots for their appointments seamlessly. The calendar should provide clear visual indicators of booked and available slots, allowing students to make informed decisions quickly and easily.
