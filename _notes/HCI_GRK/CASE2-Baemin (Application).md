## I. Introduction
Baemin is a prominent food delivery service in South Korea, providing users with a platform to order food from various restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep. The service aims to offer convenience and a wide range of dining options to customers.
## II. Issues and Challenges
- **Absence of comparison function:** Baemin does not offer a comparison function between menews or restarants, requiring the user to revisit each shop page to compare prices, options, or restrictions themselves.
- **Lack of review filtering function:** Users often rely on other's reviews before they order foods. However, the review pages only display their contents in chronological order or scored order.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- Add comparison function between restaurarnts dealing with similar menus to enable users to make informed choices based on various factors.
- Include a filtering function in the review page, allowing users to assess specific menu items and their respective satisfaction level.
