## I. Introduction
Starbucks Siren Order is a mobile application designed to streamline the ordering process for Starbucks customers. The app aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for users to order and pay for their favorite beverages and food items in advance, reducing wait times at physical stores.
## II. Issues and Challenges
- Lack of Expected Wait Time Information: The Starbucks Siren Order system does not provide customers with the expected time to receive their drinks before placing an order. Consequently, users ordering coffee remotely do not have access to information regarding the café's current occupancy or how long it might take to fulfill their order. This limitation results in user frustration and inconvenience, as customers are unable to make informed decisions based on the café's current wait times or crowd levels.

- Inflexible Order Cancellation Policy: The application does not allow users to cancel their orders once placed, even if the drink has not yet been prepared. This restriction can be problematic, particularly in instances where a customer changes their mind or encounters an unexpected situation, leading to dissatisfaction and a negative user experience. The lack of an order cancellation feature further limits user autonomy and flexibility, potentially resulting in wasted resources and customer dissatisfaction.

## III. Proposed Solutions
- Implement a feature within the app that provides real-time updates on the cafe's current queue status and estimated wait time. This feature can help users gauge the cafe's busyness at a glance, enabling them to make informed decisions about when to place their orders or whether to visit the cafe in person.
- Provide a brief period after order placement and before make a drink, during which users can easily modify or cancel their orders without any repercussions.
